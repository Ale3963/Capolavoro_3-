                <p>I lamented when I knew in my head <br>
                    she laughed as she rolled <br>
                    I don’t know if it’s lonely or love <br>
                    I threw out the human form <br>
                    <br>
                    Proof of existence full of words that I can’t hold<br>
                    <br>
                    I can’t get out of this little theater<br>
                    When I realize it, I want to run away at the end<br>
                    we were all playing<br>
                    I’m heading towards the end roll<br>
                    <br>
                    Come on, everyone desperately plays their part There’s no bystanders<br>
                    <br>
                    There’s no such thing as “I”<br>
                    I’m not anywhere<br>
                    Forever I can’t become anyone<br>
                    <br>
                    We are now eating each other<br>
                    Overtime Surrender<br>
                    Mayday pale affection<br>
                    Love and hate of words<br>
                    <br>
                    Are you looking forward to some dramatic development?<br>
                    <br>
                    You and she are YES YES hold your breath<br>
                    she was there<br>
                    Headshots, even the thoughts that make a fuss<br>
                    Shoot through that heart, now<br>
                    Pulling an unseen thread, the appearance of the mastermind<br>
                    reflected in those eyes<br>
                    <br>
                    It broke when I touched it<br>
                    I made a mistake and kept silent<br>
                    we were all innocent<br>
                    Before I knew it, I became a monster<br>
                    <br>
                    Can’t you move forward without affirming all of them?<br>
                    <br>
                    “Well, it’s probably impossible for you.”<br>
                    “So it’s probably impossible for you.”<br>
                    Before I knew it, I was in the outfield<br>
                    I’ve been flying all the time<br>
                    <br>
                    Everyone desperately protects themselves and waits for a helping hand<br>
                    <br>
                    I don’t want to think<br>
                    I want to be a fool<br>
                    Forever I can’t become anyone<br>
                    <br>
                    So now stand on the front lines<br>
                    that flag flew high<br>
                    Inferiority Relying partner<br>
                    I don’t even need words<br>
                    <br>
                    Let’s dot heat the dramatic development<br>
                    <br>
                    You and she are YES YES hold your breath<br>
                    Promise to meet again<br>
                    I have only one chance<br>
                    take a moment<br>
                    Like a climax, my hands are sweating<br>
                    cried out<br>
                    <br>
                    The hidden truth is nowhere to be found<br>
                    There is no place for those who laugh<br>
                    There is no emotion even though I remember it<br>
                    There is no reason for the tears I shed<br>
                    <br>
                    I can’t even feel the warmth of your kindness<br>
                    I have no doubts about the outstretched hand<br>
                    A hole has opened and love has fallen<br>
                    You looked at me when I was about to fall<br>
                    <br>
                    In front of someone who was about to give up, you<br>
                    Always mockingly arrogant<br>
                    how do i look to you<br>
                    Catch your breath, she’s come on<br>
                    <br>
                    Forever I can’t become anyone<br>
                    <br>
                    We are now eating each other<br>
                    Overtime Surrender<br>
